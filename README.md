# Number Swapper

This script swaps two integers _without_ introducing new variables, using tuple unpacking. This is very similar to destructuring in JavaScript.

## Run script

Using >= python 3.3:

```
python swap.py
```

You'll be prompted to enter two numbers:

```
Swap two numbers! (prepare to be amazed ðŸ˜Ž)
Type 'exit' to stop swapping

Enter first number: 7
Enter second number: 3
```

It will then print the original input and then the swapped input

```
original - x: 7, y: 3
swapped - x: 3, y: 7
ðŸ’ƒ ðŸ•º
```

To stop swapping, type `exit` as one of the numbers.

## Run Tests

After you're done swapping, you'll be prompted to run tests (default is Y(es))

```
run tests? [Y/n]: y

.....

Ran 5 tests in 0.000s

OK
```
