# Number Swapper

This script swaps two integers _without_ introducing new variables. It makes use of casting to strings (with concatenation) then back to ints.

## Run script

Using >= python 3.3
`python swap.py`

You'll be prompted to enter two numbers:

```
Enter first number: 7
Enter second number: 3
```

It will then print the original input and then the swapped input

```
original - x: 7, y: 3
swapped - x: 3, y: 7
```

You can keep swapping numbers until you enter `stop` as one of the numbers.

## Run Tests

After you're done swapping, you'll be prompted to run tests (default is Y(es))

```
run tests? [Y/n]: y

.....
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 5 tests in 0.000s

OK
```
